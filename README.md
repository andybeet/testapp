A test app to demonstrate the process of transforming a shiny app to an R package. The repo originates with the app in its traditional form. The commit history steps through changes made from this to its final state - an R package.

Note: This is packaging is currently only set up for running locally. A few further steps are necessary to enable it to be installed on a shiny server.
